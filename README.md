# **NOTE**

This is in no way code that I consider good. I wrote it a long time ago and it does not reflect my current abilities or coding conventions. Travelog was an app that I had pursued for a while, but it failed - find out why: https://medium.com/@mckapur/shipping-travelog-875914b05f8f

# Travelog

Travelog allows you to access important travel info you need, fast.

Record a flight, and get access to weather, news, plug sizes, places of interest, translations, currency conversions, timezones, and more!

On top of this, Travelog is a social platform, you can create connections with people, and check out when they will be in the city you're traveling to. From there, you can message them and setup meetings, or catch up!
